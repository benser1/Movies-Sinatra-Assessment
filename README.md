This Sinatra site collects and shows a user their movie collection. The process is quite simple. You must first create an account, then you will be redirected to your collection page. This page will allow you to add movies to your collection, and then it will compile the list for you in alphabetical order.

Once you have an account and have started adding movies, you can then edit your collection by editing the movie name, year it was released, or delete a movie from the collection. The site itself is stylized to the most basic degree with a bootstrap stylesheet. It functions properly for a first version, but there are certainly improvements that could be made.
